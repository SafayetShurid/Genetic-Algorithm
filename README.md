# Genetic-Algorithm
It is a project which I did in my Masters Course in Machine learning at Ã˜stfold University. In this project, 
I wrote a genetic algorithm which takes string which consists of binary values and tries to find the best solution
where a string will only contain 1s and no zeros. The parameters for each function can be modified through the 
Unity Editor such as length of the string, population size, crossover rate, mutation rate , elite rate and the 
number of generation.

To Run this, Open a blank project in Unity and drag the scrip to a gameobject.
You can manipulate the paramter values in the inspector.
